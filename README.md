🌿 Vivi Wellness — Shopify-powered Wellness Platform

Vivi Wellness is a conceptual wellness platform that combines a Shopify-based product store, curated recipes and articles managed via Sanity CMS, and an AI-driven chatbot for guidance and interaction.

The project was built as a frontend UI/UX showcase, with a focus on smooth interactions, connected content, and modern e-commerce integration.

"Wellness through clarity." — the philosophy of Vivi Wellness is reflected in its design, structure, and code.
